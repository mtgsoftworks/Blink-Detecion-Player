# Blink Detecion PlayerÂ®
It is a software that has the ability to stop and play the videos watched on youtube and rewind when the eyes of this software are closed and opened.

Download and extract shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat to \...\Blink Detection Player\blink_detection_engine\blink_detection\model_landmarks
then download and discard \...\Blink Detection Player\blink_detection_engine\emotion_detection  model_dropout.hdf5.

To run the program, install the priorities and requirements. Using the code "pip install -r requirements.txt", then compile the liveness_detection.py file, this will make the engine work and finally run the youtube_control.py file.
